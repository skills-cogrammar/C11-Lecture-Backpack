""" ****** Encapsulation ****** """

""" ==================================
Access Modifiers are used to specify the accessibility or visibility of a class,
its members (methods and variables), and other entities.
Access modifiers define the scope in which these elements can be accessed.
They are essential for implementing encapsulation,
one of the fundamental principles of OOP.
"""

"""
Accessible from outside the class or module.
Part of the public interface.

print(my_object.public_variable)

# ================ 2. Protected Variable
"""
No name mangling is applied.
Conventional indication that the variable is for internal use.

Name mangling is applied.
Accessible with a mangled name from outside the class.
Not a strict access control mechanism, more of a convention.

Getter methods, are used to retrieve the values of private or protected attributes.
They provide read-only access to the internal state of an object.
The naming convention for a getter method is typically get_attribute(), ie. get_value

Setter methods, are used to modify the values of private or protected attributes.

enforce validation rules. The naming convention for a setter method is 
typically set_attribute().
